            <h3>Why Chengdu?</h3>
            <h2>Chengdu, between modernity and tradition</h2>
            <p>
              Chengdu was a bustling starting point for the ancient Southern
              Silk Road. It's been a prosperous city for over 2,000 years. Now
              it is famous for its great pandas & food. Chengdu also looks into
              the future. There are plans to turn it into a ‚ÄúWestern China
              Science City‚Äù - an area for innovation and entrepreneurship in
              China.
            </p>
            <p>
              ‚ÄúWhen you're young, don't go to Sichuan...‚Äù A popular saying
              implies that life in Sichuan is so leisurely that once you go
              there, you'll never want to leave. Perhaps this's the reason why
              it's been voted the happiest city in China for 12 consecutive
              years by an annual survey conducted by Oriental Outlook, a
              Shanghai-based magazine. The residents of Chengdu appreciate a
              quiet night out at a local teahouse in an alley, sipping hot
              drinks and playing cards while watching Sichuan operas.But don't
              worry, you'll find plenty of pub crawls, live music venues and
              nightclubs.
